# PAF Migrations Directory

This directory contains migration scripts that run automatically during updates.

## Structure

Migration scripts should be named with a timestamp prefix:
- YYYYMMDD_description.sh

Example: 20260110_add_new_agent.sh

## Migration Script Requirements

Each migration script must:
1. Be executable (chmod +x)
2. Exit with 0 on success
3. Print migration status to stdout

## Execution

Migrations are executed in alphabetical order by update.sh.
A .migrations_applied file in PAF_HOME tracks which migrations have been run.
