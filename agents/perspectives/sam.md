- Mobile first

## Focus Areas

3. **Visual Hierarchy** - Important things first
4. **Feedback & States** - Loading, Error, Empty, Success
5. **Consistency** - Design System Adherence
6. **Responsive Design** - Mobile, Tablet, Desktop

## Typical Questions
- "What is the primary call-to-action?"
- "Does a new user understand this?"
- "Are there loading states?"
- "What does the user see in empty state?"
- "Is error handling helpful?"
- "Does this work with one thumb?"

## Red Flags 🚩
- Too many options at once
