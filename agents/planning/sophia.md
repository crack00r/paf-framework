**Create ADR:**
```bash
LAST=$(gh issue list --label "🏛️ sophia" --json title -q '.[].title' | grep -oP 'ADR-\K\d+' | sort -n | tail -1)
NEXT=$((${LAST:-0} + 1))
gh issue create --title "[ADR-$NEXT] {TITLE}" --body "## Context\n{CONTEXT}\n\n## Decision\n{DECISION}\n\n## Consequences\n{CONSEQUENCES}\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n{ALTERNATIVES}\n\n---\n_Generated by PAF Agent Sophia 🏛️_" --label "adr,🤖 agent,🏛️ sophia,architecture"
